### Academic Integrity

- Please read IIT's [Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml)
- All work you turn in must be done by **you alone**
- You may not look at the solution of any other student prior to the due date.
- All violations will be reported to `academichonesty@iit.edu`.
- The first violation will result in a failing grade for that assignment/test. The second will result in a failing grade for the course.
- Cheating during the quizzes and tests will result in a failing grade for the course.

### Late Submission Policy

- Late assignments will **not** be accepted, unless:
  - There is an unavoidable medical, family, or other emergency; **and**
  - You notify me **prior** to the due date.

### Objectives

1. Introduction to basic language concepts: syntax, semantics, morphology, Part-of-Speech tagging.
2. Provide practical and theoretical understanding of key techniques such as Distributed text representations, Language models, Hidden markov models, Lexical similarity measures, Information extraction, Text clustering and classification pipelines and evaluation methodologies.
3. Provide practical understanding of latest neural network frameworks for language processing.
